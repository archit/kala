Kala - a jQuery plugin for time inputs.

The primary purpose of this plugin is to be strict about limit-ing the characters allowed in a enabled
html input. It tries to do its best in restricting input to the format 

xx : xx am | pm | AM | PM

Nothing fancy here. Shout out to http://www.texotela.co.uk/code/jquery/numeric/ for inspiring this.
